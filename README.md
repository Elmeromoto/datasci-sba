# datasci-sba (Small Business Association
Data Science Working Group working with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to create interactive applications, models, visualizations, and much more.

This project is part of [Data Science Working Group at Code for San Francisco](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg)

## Project Description
At a fundamental level, what the SBA does is a public/private partnership.

The SBA is engaged with in business support in three primary areas:
1. Finance
2. Education
* Counseling
* Incubator spaces
* Mentoring
* Contracting (helping small businesses with federal government. By law 23 % of federal government contracts are reserved for small businesses)
3. Disaster Relief
-- Can get financing after disaster hits

SBA still is the federal government (but fairly decentralized agency)
businesses Owners very rarely interact directly with the SBA
Businesses owners will go to a bank and get a loan backed by SBA
Businesses owners might go to non-profit funded by SBA to get counseling, etc.

The district office plays a compliance role (making sure partners live up to agreement)
They also make the case of SBA programs and bring in new partners.
Identifying successful, popular businesses that benefited from SBA programs.

Cities don't know SBA exists because SBA doesn't necessarily fund them. This is a problem especially from disaster relief perspective

Description of Challenges
Get all loan data for SBA data made open and public.
People want to know who are benefiting SBA loans
One challenge is to visualize and identify businesses who have received SBA funding.

One of the largest challenges to SBA is increasing their profile so people know who they are

SBA definition of Small Business
--500 employees or fewer
--Exclude public traded companies, etc. 

Two major challenges from office perspective
1. Identifying businesses who have benefited from SBA program
--Even 7a or 504 program, businesses move, businsses change names, etc.
--The big spreadsheet is not the most accessible either.
--Goal: Map this data out!!

2. We have limited personnel, limited resources. Currently decisions being made about where we are doing outreach, where we are going to do partnership, right now it's a bit haphazard.
--We would rather focus our outreach efforts towards underserved areas. (In generally we want a way to figure out how to prioritize certain areas)
