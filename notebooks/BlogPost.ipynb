    "The Data Science Working Group of San Francisco has partnered with the San Francisco District Office (SFDO) of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to tackle several questions. In particular, we were tasked with identifying areas that were underserved by the Small Business Administration to help the SFDO more effectively allocate their resources. We also wanted to better visualize the businesses that have utilized SBA resources so that city officials could better identify which businesses in their region have been helped by the SBA and have become major success stories."

    "The SBA is a public/private partnership. The SBA is a federal government agency, albeit fairly decentralized. In particular, business owners very rarely interact directly with the SBA. For example, a business owner will still go to a bank to get a loan backed by the SBA (as opposed to going directly into an SBA office to get a loan).

    "In addition, the SBA provides other services such as: counseling, incubator spaces, mentoring, and contracting (helping small businesses with federal government. By law 23 % of federal government contracts are reserved for small businesses). The SBA district office plays a compliance role (making sure partners live up to agreement). They also make the case of SBA programs and bring in new partners. Ideally, we want to be able to identify successful, popular businesses that benefited from SBA programs."
